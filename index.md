Hello my name is Nick and I built a 3 in 1 sunfounder smart car learning kit. In this program I learned about coding and how different functions work. It was a very fun and a difficult challenge to understand what the code for the arduino meant but it was also fun makin my own code. I am very glad that I came to this program because it was very worth it.

 # Final Milestone 

My final milestone, I've come a long way from where I started just a couple of months ago and have added a lot to my project. I had to add another bread board for a seven segment display. I learned with the help of my teachers how to code the pins so power is coming out of them and how to work with a type of funciton called digitalwrite. I also added a passive buzzer that beeps for one second everytime I push the button to back up. I had to code the buzzer to work on pins and connect it to the move backward part of a function called void loop. The final thing I did to my robot was coding it so the seven segment display would display whatever number I pushed on my remote. It was challenging to figure out how to code the robot correctly to follow the remote control code and the seven segment display code. Engineering Up was a very fun expierience and I would love to come back next year.

# First Milestone 
![first milestone](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54184726282_c0731d9da7_n.jpg)

My first milestone was being able to make a light on the arduino blink and then building the 3 in 1 smart car learning kit that is compatible with the arduino motherboard. It was challenging building the car because even though there were directions I still made various mistakes but I did not give up and I finished building the arduino. After I finsihed building the arduino I had to wire the robot which was a little bit of a pain. There was a website that I had to follow which was a diagram of the wiring. The wiring is different for all of the projects and the project I chose the remote control module.
