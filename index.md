# Nick's Arduino Robot
Hello my name is Nick and I built a 3 in 1 sunfounder smart car learning kit. In this program Ilearned about coding and how different functions work.

# Final Milestone

My final milestone, I've come a long way from where I started just a couple of months ago and have added a lot to my project. I had to add another bread board for a seven segment display. I learned with the help of my teachers how to code the pins so power is coming out of them and how to work with a type of funciton called digitalwrite.

My first milestone was being able to make a light ont he arduino blink and then building the 3 in 1 smart car learning kit that is compatible with the arduino motherboard. It was challenging building the car because even though there were directions i still made various mistakes but,I didn't give up and i finished building the arduino. After I finsihed building the arduino i had to wire the robot which was a little bit of a pain. There was a website that I had to follow which was a diagram of the wiring.The wiring is different for all of the projects and the project I chose the remote control module.
