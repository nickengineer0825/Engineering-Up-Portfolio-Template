# Final Milestone

My final milestone, I've come a long way from where I started just a couple of months ago and have added a lot to my project. I've stripped away a lot of the parts that were originally on the robot to create room for my kicking arm. I changed the code a lot to accommodate the second H-Bridge which I go more in-depth about in my video below. I've loved this journey so far and I can't wait to see where this takes me in my future career.

My first milestone was being able to make a light ont he arduino blink and then building the 3 in 1 smart car learning kit that is compatible with the arduino motherboard. It was challenging building the car because even though there were directions i still made various mistakes but,I didn't give up and i finished building the arduino. After I finsihed building the arduino i had to wire the robot which was a little bit of a pain. There was a website that I had to follow which was a diagram of the wiring.The wiring is different for all of the projects and the project I chose the remote control module.
